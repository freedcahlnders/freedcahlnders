The new law effective today is the most consequential and balanced payday loan reform enacted by any state. It achieves three fundamental goals: affordable payments, lower prices, and reasonable time to repay. When loans issued under previous law become illegal in April, it will enable credit to flow while transforming Ohioâ€™s small loans into some of the safest and lowest-cost products available anywhere in the country. The law will protect consumers from the unaffordable payday loans that often led them into long-term cycles of debt, with 83 percent of the loans taken out within two weeks of a previous loan.
